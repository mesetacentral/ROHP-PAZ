just built a regression model by stacking classificators
thought the precision would be higher because scores were higher than 80% in most cases, it may be due to the simplification made when adding up the predictions or maybe it needs more data, from higher and lower heights

when comparing val data to the regressions output, the shapes might be similar but the values rarely are
